# Zoek Algoritmes

This project demonstrates the implementation of two search algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search. The user can input a target number, and the application will search for this number in a sorted array of 10,000 random numbers using both algorithms, displaying the results and the time taken for each search.

## Introduction
This project showcases the efficiency of Linear Search and Binary Search algorithms. It allows users to input a target number and see how quickly each algorithm can find the number in a large dataset.

## Features
- **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks each element in the array sequentially.
- **Binary Search**: A more efficient search algorithm that divides the array in half to find the target number.
- **Performance Comparison**: Displays the time taken by each algorithm to find the target number.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zoek-algoritmes.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd zoek-algoritmes
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to use the application.

## Technologies
- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **PHP**: For handling form submissions and implementing the search algorithms.
